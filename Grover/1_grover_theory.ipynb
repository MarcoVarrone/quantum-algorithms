    "Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm to find one or multiple elements in a unordered database or set.<br>\n",

In some cases the probability may not reach 100%, but it usually approches it quite closely.<br>\n",
    "The algorithm applies the Hadamard gate (this gate will be explained later on) to the qubits of the systems, then two other operators are iteratively applied (the Oracle and the Diffusion operators) until the solution as the maximum probability, after which it measures the value of the qubits.<br>\n",

It is an operator $O$ that is able to verify if an element is a solution, note that being able to realize this operator is not equivalent to being able to solve the problem. Take as an example the problem of factorization: verifying that two numbers are factors of another number is much easier than finding these two numbers. <br>\n",

    "What the Hadamard gate $H$ does it to put a system in <b>superposition</b>, which means that every state in that system is equally probable. In a system with $n$ qubits there are $N=2^{n}$ possible states, so, for example, in a system with 2 qubits ($|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle$) there are 4 possible states ($|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle, |11\\rangle$).<br>\n",

    "The coefficient of each basis state is called <b>amplitude</b> $\\alpha$, and $\\alpha^{2}$ is equal to the probability of that state. Hence, in the previous case, all the states have probability equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n",

    "Then the Diffusion operator performs an inversion around the mean. This results in the amplitude of the solution to become positive again and being amplified. For the fact that all the probabilities have to sum up to 1, the amplitude of the other states (which are not solutions) decreases. <br>\n",
    "For example in this case the mean is $ m = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}}}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$, so the distance between the non-solution states and the mean value is $ \\Delta_{1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}= \\frac{1}{4}$ while for the solution state and the mean value is $ \\Delta_{2} = \\frac{1}{4} - (-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{3}{4}$.<br>\n",

    "Now we can start to understand how the algorithm works: by applying iteratively the $O$ and $D$ the amplitudes of the non-solutions decrease, while the one of the solution gets closer and closer to 1.<br>\n",
    "For this reason, when we will measure the qubits, there will be a high probability of obtaining the solution.\n",
    "In the case of 2 qubits, after one iteration, the probability of measuring the solution state is already 1, but in other cases the probability doesn't reach 1, but a close value. <br>\n",
    "    It can be proved that the number of iterations to be performed to obtain the maximum value for the solution amplitude is $\\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\sqrt{N}$. Notice that a higher number of iterations will start to decrease the amplitude of the solution.\n"

    "The result of the two reflections is actually a rotation! This rotation moves $|\\phi\\rangle$ closer and closer to the $|\\beta\\rangle$ axis. So, as we have seen in the amplitude interpretation, the probability of $|\\beta\\rangle$ increases at each iteration. "
